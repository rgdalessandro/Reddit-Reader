# Reddit Reader
- A single page application built with React.js that displays Reddit posts with a simple, clean interface on desktop and mobile browsers.
- This application was built strictly under a 5-hour time constraint.
- Given more time, I would have added the ability to remove certain subreddits from view, and also filtering and sorting features.

## Set Up Instructions:
1) Run npm install in your terminal

2) Run npm start in your terminal

3) Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/
